* explain in the `README` how to run, develop and build
* be developed in a public repository from the start
* provide a link to a public list of known issues and bugs
* allow non-contributors to post issues, bugs and suggested changes

* have test and documentation code coverage to the highest degree possible
* have documented private APIs
* use a version number compatible with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
* provide documentation on privacy and security
* contain configurations for automatic deployment and provisioning through systems such as OpenShift, Docker, Ansible, CloudForge etc

Projects MAY:

* publish a roadmap
* provide a forum or mailing list for discussion
* publish packages to relevant language specific repositories such as PyPi, Ruby Gems, NPM, Puppet Forge, etc
* provide a contribution and governance model in a `GOVERNANCE` file
* indicate the level of maintainance provided by whom and until when
